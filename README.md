Favorite Movie: Inside Out
1. Inside Out is a Pixar animated movie that explores the emotions and thoughts inside the mind of a young girl named Riley.
2. The movie personifies her emotions - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust - as characters in her mind.
3. The film encourages the full spectrum of emotions, conveying that they all are an essential part of life and there is nothing wrong with feeling sad.

- I love how the movie conveyed the complexity of a person's emotion.
- It beautifully transforms emotional conflict into an adventure, a surreal look at the internal machinations that encompass why we feel the way we do.
